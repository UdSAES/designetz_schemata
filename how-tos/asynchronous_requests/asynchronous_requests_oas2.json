        "title": "Handling Asynchronous Requests in Designetz",
        "description": "This document describes a possible solution for dealing with asynchronous requests. It is suggested to use this method in _all_ services that are developed and used within the Designetz-project.\n\nAs an example, consider the following scenario: the creation of a new forecast for a solar power plant is known to take some time (minutes, possibly hours). Thus, just waiting for the response to a `POST`-request to the endpoint `/forecasts/solar-power` would most likely result in a timeout for the service consumer.\n\nIn order to avoid this, the server immediately responds to the request by sending a `202 Accepted` with a link to a resource exposing the current status (of the creation of the forecast). The client then polls this resource until it receives a `303 See Other` with the link to the resource that exposes the initially requested forecast.\n\n![Sequence diagram](https://github.com/UdSAES/designetz_schemata/raw/master/resources/asynchronous_requests_uml_sequence.png)\n\nConsequently, service developers have to take care of two scenarios:\n\n1. __Processing a request received on a certain endpoint could take a long time due to some long-running background job.__ In this case, the server must _always_ process the request using the mechanism described above, even if it could be possible to respond immediately from time to time.\n\n2. __When processing a request, another endpoint, which requires polling, is called.__ Again, the server must _always_ process the request using the mechanism described above.\n\nReferences:\n* [Farazgadi, Victor (2014): REST and long-running jobs.
